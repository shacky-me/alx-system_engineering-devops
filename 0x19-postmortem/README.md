MY FIRST POSTMOTERM
Issue Summary:
Duration: 30 minutes (10:15 AM PST - 10:45 AM PST)
Impact: Our company website, wildflowerlabs.com, experienced slow loading times and intermittent outages. Users reported difficulty accessing product pages and slow response times for search functions. Approximately 20% of website visitors were affected during the outage.
Root Cause: Database server overload due to a runaway query.
Timeline:
10:15 AM EAT: Monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden spike in database server load.
10:16 AM EAT: An engineer on call identified the alert and began investigating the cause. Initial suspicion was a surge in website traffic.
10:18 AM EAT: Traffic logs confirmed normal user activity, eliminating a traffic overload as the cause.
10:20 AM  EAT - 10:30 AM EAT : Investigation focused on database queries. A specific product search query was identified as taking unusually long to execute, consuming excessive resources. This query was flagged as a potential culprit.
10:30 AM EAT - 10:35 AM EAT : The problematic query was temporarily disabled while a permanent fix was developed. Website performance immediately improved.
10:35 AM EAT - 10:40 AM EAT : The development team identified a logical error in the product search query that caused unnecessary data retrieval. A patched version of the query was implemented.
10:45 AM EAT : Website performance returned to normal. All functionalities were restored.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the outage was a poorly optimized product search query containing a logical error. This error led to excessive data retrieval from the database, overloading the server and causing slow response times for all website functionalities.
To resolve the issue, the problematic query was temporarily disabled, followed by the implementation of a patched version with the logical error corrected. The patched query retrieved only the necessary data, significantly reducing the load on the database server.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improve Code Review Process: Implement a more rigorous code review process to catch potential query optimization issues at the development stage. This might include unit tests specifically designed to identify inefficient database queries.
Enhanced Database Monitoring: Fine-tune database monitoring to provide more granular insights into individual query performance. This will allow for quicker identification of resource-intensive queries in the future.
Automatic Query Optimization: Explore implementing automated tools that can flag and potentially optimize inefficient database queries.
Task List:
Implement unit tests for database queries (development team)
Review and adjust database monitoring thresholds (operations team)
Research and propose options for automated query optimization tools (development team lead)
