MY FIRST POSTMOTERM
Issue Summary:
Duration: 30 minutes (10:15 AM PST - 10:45 AM PST)
Impact: Our company website, wildflowerlabs.com, experienced slow loading times and intermittent outages. Users reported difficulty accessing product pages and slow response times for search functions.

As you can see, the server was overwhelmed by a single, inefficient query, causing everything to slow down. But fear not, our very skilled developers identified the culprit - a poorly written search query that was trying to pick every flower at once. (not efficient). Anyway, with a few tweaks, we were able to optimize the query and everything's back to normal.
